# CODECRAFT_DS_01

## Project Overview

This repository contains tasks and projects completed as part of the CODECRAFT_DS_01 initiative. The goal is to explore data science concepts and implement them in Python. One of the key tasks in this project is creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as ages or genders in a population.

## Task Details

### Objective

To visualize the distribution of a variable using Python, providing insights into the data through clear and effective visualizations.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this task contains information on a population, including attributes like age and gender. The specific variable visualized in this task depends on the analysis requirement:
- **Age Distribution**: Visualized using a histogram.
- **Gender Distribution**: Visualized using a bar chart.

### Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were utilized:
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn** (optional): For enhancing the aesthetic of the visualizations.

### How to Use
**1.Clone the repository:**<br>
<pre> git clone https://github.com/Shraddha-Deshmukh2119/CODECRAFT_DS_01.git
cd CODECRAFT_DS_01</pre>
<br>

**2.Install the required dependencies:**
<br>
 <pre>     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn</pre>
<br>

**3.Run the Python script provided in the repository to generate the visualizations:**
<br>
<pre> python script_name.py</pre>
<br>

### Visualizations
<br>

**Age Distribution (Histogram):** Demonstrates how ages are distributed across the dataset.
<br>

**Gender Distribution (Bar Chart):** Shows the frequency of each gender in the dataset.
